## mac-ansible
A one-stop shop repository for collecting all artefacts related to my Macbook configurations for easy redeployment

### Improvements to make
On the previous execution, I took the following notes to help future proof it:
Had to manually install home-brew
Had to manually share over ssh keys via airdrop
Had to use home-brew to install Ansible so I could then run Ansible
(This could have perhaps been a separate shell script to get this going before jumping into the main swing of things) 


Do I use the brew bundle file to maintain whatâ€™s installed ? Or do I use the jeffgeerling stuff???
 

New automation idea
Script that will:
- Obtain / push SSH keys to the machine
- Git clone (Via ssh now) to get Mac-ansible side of it
- Install home-brew via the curl command on the site
- Install ansible via home-brew
- Start the ansible playbook process
- Move the .zshrc file after ohmyzsh has been installed

What about the home-brew file ??
`Brew bundle` is all you need


Oh my Zsh is a manual curl command 
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
